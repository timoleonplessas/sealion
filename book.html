                          <p>The existing guidelines regarding the management of biofouling, lack the overall connection between the <span>visual inspection</span> (e.g. underwater inspection), the <span>performance prediction</span> (e.g. estimation of added Power/Fuel Consumption) and the relevant <span>action</span> (e.g. hull cleaning). MEPC's "Guidelines for the control and management of ship's biofouling to minimize the transfer of invasive aquatic species" offers a simple methodology that links the visual aspect with the required action based on a fouling rating, but doesn't offer much guidelines regarding the expected performance prediction based on the observed biofouling. On the other hand, ISO 19030 focuses on the analysis of high-frequency data in order to estimate the performance of the vessel but doesn’t offer much guidelines on how this performance prediction is connected to the observed fouling. The methodology presented in the book attempts to bridge the gap between these two approaches. It doesn't provide the accuracy of the ISO standard, but it will always provide <span>reliable rough estimations of the performance of a ship within seconds, by utilizing only underwater photos</span> (no other information/data/logs required).</p>

                                    <p>My name is Timoleon Plessas and I am the founder of Sealion Engineering. I have studied Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens and I hold a PhD in the field of “Ship Design Optimization”. I have participated with the National Technical University of Athens in EU-funded projects where I developed models and tools for simulation and optimization of various systems of merchant ships with numerous peer-reviewed papers published in journals and conferences. I have also worked in the energy department of a large Greek shipping company with 70+ ships of various types and sizes. There, I participated in the monitoring of vessel’s performance by developing sophisticated tools for handling high-frequency data and arranging underwater hull inspections and hull cleanings.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                        </div>

                        <div class="how-is-content">

                            <p>This experience gave me a better understanding on how the observed fouling is linked to the actual performance of the vessel since the effect was measured by the installed sensors.</p>

                            <p>In short, the main idea of this book is simple: <b>The effect of fouling in the performance of a ship can be adequately quantified based on the observed condition on the hull</b>. Although it can’t be quantified down to the last digit, its effect in general can be put within an expected range in terms of power increase just by observing it.</p>

                            <p>So, I studied the available scientific research on the subject and used the most appropriate methods, in order to transform the qualitative and empirical knowledge to a formal methodology and create a simple and quick solution, that will help anyone to skip the years of experience needed in order to <b>feel confident about how the observed fouling affects the performance of a ship using nothing else other than a few underwater photographs</b>.</p>

                            <p>This methodology can be applied to ships of all types and sizes. 450+ diagrams that predict the effect of fouling have been generated and included in the book in order to make it a stand alone tool for monitoring the performance of a ship when no other information is available other than a few underwater photos.</p>

                          <h4>Does it take time to do the calculations?</h4>
                          <p><b>No.</b> The calculations can be done very quickly in order to support and speed up the decision making process when deciding wether to proceed with hull cleaning. You only need the readings from the relevant diagrams (depending on the vessel type and size) and the effect of fouling in ship performance (Power & Fuel Consumption) can be estimated instantly.</p>

                          <h4>Is it complicated?</h4>
                          <p><b>No. Calculations can be done by hand or by a simple excel file</b> (many examples and a case study are included in the book).</p>

                          <h4>What else is needed except from this book in order to have a rough estimation of the fuel consumption due to fouling?</h4>
                          <p><b>Nothing. You only need this book and a few recent underwater photos.</b> NO logs, NO noon reports, NO measurements, NO sensors, NO data analysis.</p>

                          <h4>Is it 100% accurate?</h4>
                          <p><b>No. It is a rough estimation</b>. It will never be 100% accurate since all the observations that are involved in the calculations (type of fouling, percentage of coverage etc.) are never 100% accurate or strictly defined. Still, you will always get a reliable estimations since the developed methodology takes into account the underlying principles of ship's resistance and propulsion theory.</p>

                          <h4>Do I need to be experienced in Ship Performance Monitoring?</h4>
                          <p><b>No.</b> The aim of this book is to allow anyone (even with <b>zero experience</b>) to have a rough estimate of the effect of fouling just by looking a few photos, feel confident about what to expect and not having to rely on an expert.</p>

                          <h4>To whom is this book useful?</h4>
                          <p><b>To anyone</b> who works in any aspect of the shipping industry and wants to have an estimation of the effect of fouling in fuel consumption (ship owners, operators, charterers, captains, chief engineers, superintended engineers, energy/performance engineers etc.)</p>

                          <h4>Does it work in complex cases where there are different types of fouling, or when for example bottom is clean and verticals are fouled?</h4>
                          <p><b>Yes.</b> Detailed examples on how to handle complex cases are presented in the book.</p>

                          <h4>In which types of ships can this methodology be applied?</h4>
                          <p><b>In most of the common merchant ship types and sizes</b>:
                           <ul>

                             <li>General Cargo Ships (2,000 to 45,000 t DWT)</li>
                             <li>OBO Carriers (60,000 to 160,000 t DWT)</li>

                          <p>The book focuses on hull fouling. Regardless, there is a brief chapter with some rough guidelines regarding the effect of propeller fouling in ship performance.</p>

                          <h4>Can the methodology handle engines with different fuels other than Diesel Oil and Heavy Fuel Oil?</h4>
                          <p><b>Yes.</b> Calculations rely on additional engine power, so as long as specific fuel consumption of the engine (for any type of fuel) is available, the methodology is applicable.</p>
