                                    <p>My name is Timoleon Plessas and I am the founder of Sealion Engineering. I have studied Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens and I hold a PhD in the field of “Ship Design Optimization”. I have participated with the National Technical University of Athens in EU-funded projects where I developed models and tools for simulation and optimization of various systems of merchant ships with numerous peer-reviewed papers published in journals and conferences. I have also worked in the energy department of a large Greek shipping company with 70+ ships of various types and sizes. There, I participated in the monitoring of vessel’s performance by developing sophisticated tools for handling high-frequency data and arranging underwater hull inspections and hull cleanings.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                        </div>

                        <div class="how-is-content">

                            <p>This experience gave me a better understanding on how the observed fouling is linked to the actual performance of the vessel since the effect was measured by the installed sensors.</p>

                            <p>In short, the main idea of this book is simple: The effect of fouling in the performance of a ship can be adequately quantified based on the observed condition on the hull. Although it can’t be quantified down to the last digit, its effect in general can be put within an expected range in terms of power increase just by observing it.</p>

                            <p>So, I studied the available scientific research on the subject and used the most appropriate methods, based on my experience, in order to transform my qualitative, empirical knowledge to a formal methodology and create a simple and quick solution, that will help anyone to skip the years of experience needed in order to have a ‘feeling’ on how the observed fouling affects the performance of a ship and be able to feel confident about what to expect in terms of ship performance based only on observation.</p>

                            <p>This methodology can be applied to ships of all types and sizes. 450+ diagrams that predict the effect of fouling have been generated and included in the book in order to make it a stand alone tool for monitoring the performance of a ship when no other information is available other than a few underwater photos.</p>
